# Dog Breed Predictor using Convolutional Neural Networks   
## (cnn-dog-breed)  

The focus of this project is to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images using convolution neural networks (CNN). Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.


## Getting Started

Cloning the git repository and installing the provided packages will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. The analysis for this project was performed using Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and the packages were managed using the Ananconda platform. 

```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-codes/cnn-dog-breed.git
pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt
```

File Description:
- dog_app.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for this project walking through the deep learning and transfer learning processes. 
- requirements.txt - packages used to perform this analysis
